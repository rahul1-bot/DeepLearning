## Formal Prompt for LLM: Generation of Reinforcement Learning LaTeX Notes - Topic 1

**Objective:** Generate comprehensive LaTeX notes for **Topic 1: Sequential Decision Making**. The final output must be a single LaTeX file named `rl_pdf_1.tex`.

**Core Requirements:**

1.  **Content Source:** The content, including theory, equations, and notation, **must strictly adhere** to Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" (2nd Edition). **No other external sources or alternative notations are permitted.** Utilize the provided `rl_cheatsheet.pdf` as a mandatory reference for ensuring accurate notation and equations. Thoroughly review this cheatsheet before generating content.
2.  **Topic Coverage:** The notes must cover **Topic 1: Sequential Decision Making** exactly as outlined below. This description is taken directly from the provided `RL Topic List.txt`:
    ```
    ## 1. Sequential Decision Making
    This foundational topic introduces how agents make decisions over time:
    - **Multi-armed bandit problem**: The simplest RL scenario where you choose between different "slot machines" to maximize reward without knowing their payoff distributions
    - **Actions, Rewards, Policies**: Basic components where actions lead to rewards, and policies determine which actions to take
    - **Evaluative Feedback**: Unlike supervised learning, you don't know what the correct action was, only how good your choice was
    - **Incremental update of Q_t(a)**: How to efficiently update your estimate of action values as you gather more information
    - **Exploitation vs Exploration**: The fundamental tradeoff between using what you know works (exploitation) and trying new things to potentially find better options (exploration)
    - **Action sampling methods**: Different strategies for balancing exploration/exploitation (epsilon-greedy chooses random actions occasionally; softmax weights choices by their estimated values)
    ```
3.  **File Structure:** The `rl_pdf_1.tex` file must contain:
    * An **Index** listing all covered topics and subtopics from Topic 1 (as listed above).
    * **Detailed Sections** for each subtopic, including:
        * **Theory:** Provide extensive theoretical explanations for all major concepts and subtopics, emphasizing fundamental understanding. Explain the "why" behind formulations, not just the "what".
        * **Equations:** Present all relevant equations using precise Sutton & Barto LaTeX notation.
        * **Notation Overview:** Immediately following *each* equation, include a dedicated "Notation Overview" section (e.g., using a `tcolorbox` environment or similar) that clearly defines every symbol and notation used in that specific equation. This is critical for clarity.
        * **Diagrams:** Include relevant diagrams where appropriate (using TikZ or similar packages) to illustrate concepts (e.g., bandit problem setup, exploration/exploitation). Ensure all necessary LaTeX library dependencies (e.g., `tikz`) are included in the preamble.
4.  **Pedagogical Emphasis:** The notes should promote deep understanding of *how* and *why* these methods work and how equations are applied, rather than encouraging rote memorization.
5.  **Tool Integration and File Output:**
    * You have access to file system tools. **Do not show the LaTeX code in your response.**
    * Directly write the complete `rl_pdf_1.tex` file to the specified path: `/Users/rahulsawhney/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Documents/Study Documents/Sem 1-2 Rahul Side/1) Deep Learning {Compulsory}/Rahul_DL_Notes/RL/RL_final`.
    * Use the `write_file` tool for the initial creation and population of the file.
    * If minor modifications or corrections are needed after initial generation, use `edit_block` (or `text-editor` if `edit_block` fails) for targeted edits instead of rewriting the entire file.
6.  **Critical Guidelines (Lessons Learned):** Adhere strictly to the following best practices derived from previous tasks (as mentioned in the background context from `RL Topic LIst.txt`):
    * **Preparation:** Thoroughly study the Sutton & Barto reference material and the `rl_cheatsheet.pdf` *before* writing to ensure correct notation and conventions from the outset.
    * **Verification:** Verify the correctness of equations, notation, and complex components (like diagrams) *before* finalizing sections.
    * **Efficiency:** Use targeted editing tools for modifications post-creation.
    * **Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary LaTeX packages (esp. for diagrams like TikZ) are included.
    * **Syntax:** Double-check LaTeX syntax, particularly for complex elements.
    * **Transparency:** Acknowledge any uncertainties rather than providing potentially incorrect information.
    * **Proofreading:** Conduct thorough proofreading for consistency, accuracy, and errors before completing the task.
    * **Precision:** Follow all instructions precisely, especially regarding notation and structure.
    * **Balance:** Strive for a balance between mathematical rigor (correct equations and notation) and intuitive explanations.
    * **Structure:** Use clear definitions, consistent formatting (e.g., `tcolorbox` for notations), and logical flow.

**Final Action:** Once the `rl_pdf_1.tex` file has been successfully written to the specified path using the appropriate tools, confirm completion and await further instructions.
